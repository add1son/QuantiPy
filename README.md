# QuantiPy

Quantify your daily antics in which you are on and/or carrying a computer. The idea of this project is to create an AIO self hosted event log that is able to bring data together automagically to create an automated log of what happened on a given day. 

The goal of this project is to be FOSS with integration with tools that are available to give a dashboard view or a skeleton of a journal that doesn't require interaction.

This project may function as a bit of a "choose your own adventure game" in that it will offer a starting ground of a dashboard. As a user of the tools listed below the output can be customized on an opt-in basis.
